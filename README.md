# stock-graphing
A collection of python programs that use yfinance and matplotlib to track and plot stocks.

### End Goal
I would like to do one of two options (or both if i can find the time):
- build a web page that allows users to pick a stock and view the stock's past data over a time period of the user's choosing
- implement a machine learning algorithm to predict future stock prices.
