# stock-graphing
A collection of python programs that use yfinance and matplotlib to track and plot stocks.

### End Goal
Either I would like to:
- build a web page that allows users to pick a stock and view the stock's past data over a time period of the user's choosing
or 
- implement a machine learning algorithm to predict future stock prices.
